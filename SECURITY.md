# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

splice is pre-1.0 (see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the versioning policy). Only `main` is
supported — there are no maintained release branches. Update to latest before reporting.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report privately via **GitHub Security Advisories**:
https://github.com/torad-labs/splice/security/advisories/new

Do not open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability.

**Do not attach tokens, API keys, `~/.codex/auth.json`, or live request/response logs to a
report.** splice proxies a live ChatGPT Codex / xAI session; captured traffic can contain
bearer tokens and conversation content. Redact secrets and trim logs to the minimal
reproducing snippet before attaching anything.

## Response Expectations

This is a personal project maintained best-effort, not a funded security team. There is no
SLA. Reports are triaged as time allows; issues touching auth bypass, the loopback bind
contract, or secret leakage get priority.
